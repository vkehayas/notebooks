    "This is a problem I faced in my Ph.D. project \n",
    "where I was dealing with images of the same structure\n",
    "acquired at different time-points.\n",
    "For that project I was imaging dendritic spines,\n",
    "microscopic protrusions emanating from neurons,\n",
    "in alive mice ([Figure 1](#Fig1)).\n",

    "their alignment was never going to be perfect\n",
    "from one time-point to the next.\n",
    "To overcome the problems that \n",
    "such misalignments may cause \n",
    "when considering changes in distance to a fixed point over time,\n",
    "say a cortical column's center or the surface of the brain,\n",
    "I had to perform some sort of image registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sources of information that can be useful when registering images are \n",
    "the intensity profiles of the image and the geometry of some of the image's features.\n",
    "For example, we could choose to calculate some correlation metric\n",
    "based on the intensity values of the image as a whole.\n",
    "Alternatively, we could take into account \n",
    "the relative positions of some structures in the image\n",
    "in order to generate the geometrical transformation.\n",
    "In our case, since spine morphology can change a lot from session to session,\n",
    "especially since the animal received externally-generated stimulation,\n",
    "I chose to focus on the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple method to register images based on feature coordinates\n",
    "is to apply a linear transformation,\n",
    "which assumes that no warping can occur between imaging sessions,\n",
    "i.e. the transformation is uniform across all structures considered.\n",
    "The possible transformations under this assumption are\n",
    "translation, rotation, scaling, and possibly reflection.\n",
